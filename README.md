## Rules

- Typescript
- 0 dependencies, except for tooling like Typescript and Eslint
- Take it easy. No ambition to solve everything or to score on the leaderboard, just having fun when I have time ([Unlike 2022 when I grinded through all 25 puzzles](https://github.com/andre-brdoch/advent-of-code-2022))
